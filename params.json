I use imdone for keep track of development of imdone\r\n\r\n**imdone will create a directory named imdone that will contain your custom configuration and a file to keep your lists in order**  \r\n- you should keep the imdone directory in source control  \r\n  \r\n**Filter by file name**  \r\n- You can filter by the file name the task are in.  \r\n- As you type in the \"filter by file name\" field, tasks are filtered\r\n  \r\nConfiguration\r\n----\r\nAfter running imdone for the first time, modify imdone/imdone.js in your project directory.
