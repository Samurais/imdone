Every donation is very much appreciated.  \r\n\r\n<a href='http://www.pledgie.com/campaigns/19536'><img alt='Click here to lend your support to: iMDone - TODO, doing, done! and make a donation at www.pledgie.com !' src='http://www.pledgie.com/campaigns/19536.png?skin_name=chrome' border='0' /></a>\r\n\r\nIf you have some spare time, then there is no better way to help an open source project than to get involved in one of the following ways.\r\n\r\n- Help diagnose and report problems\r\n- Suggest fixes by sending in patches\r\n- Improve the code\r\n- Help with unit and end-to-end testing\r\n- Provide peer support on our forum\r\n- Publish an article on your blog (send the link) to educate others regarding some aspect of the project\r\n- Help with missing documentation\r\n\r\nSee it in action!\r\n----\r\nfork this repository and run imdone in your local copy.  I use imdone for keep track of development of imdone\r\n\r\n**imdone will create a directory named imdone that will contain your custom configuration and a file to keep your lists in order**  \r\n- you should keep the imdone directory in source control  \r\n  \r\n**Filter by file name**  \r\n- You can filter by the file name the task are in.  \r\n- As you type in the \"filter by file name\" field, tasks are filtered\r\n  \r\nConfiguration\r\n----\r\nAfter running imdone for the first time, modify imdone/imdone.js in your project directory.  The default config looks like this.  Your imdone.js will extend this.\r\n  \r\n\tmodule.exports = {\r\n\t\tinclude:/^.*$/,\r\n\t\texclude:/^(node_modules|imdone|target)\\/|\\.(git|svn)\\/|\\~$|\\.(jpg|png|gif|swp)$/,\r\n\t\tmarked : {\r\n\t\t\tgfm: true,\r\n\t\t\tpedantic: false,\r\n\t\t\tsanitize: true\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t};\r\n\r\nDisclaimer\r\n----\r\niMDone has only been tested on my Ubuntu 12.04 desktop using chrome 23.0.x as the default browser.  It should work on any machine that has nodejs and npm installed and for auto update of boards, a browser that supports websockets.\r\n\r\nRoadmap\r\n----\r\n\r\n- [User should be able to easily access recently edited files](#archive:130)\r\n- [Show file explorer when editing files](#todo:50)\r\n- [Enable svn and git commit after file changes](#todo:10)\r\n- [Convert front end to use backbone.js](#todo:70)\r\n- [respect marked configuration in client javascript](#todo:0)\r\n- [User should be able to use TOC in preview mode for md files](doing:0)\r\n- [User should be able to quickly add a date and assigned to tasks using @&lt;user&gt; @&lt;date&gt;](#planning:10)\r\n- [User should be a able to use keyboard shortcut for preview](#doing:10)","google":"UA-37731114-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
