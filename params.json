It should work on any machine that has nodejs and npm installed and for auto update of boards, a browser that supports websockets.\r\n\r\n###Install\r\n   `npm install -g imdone`\r\n\r\n###And run!\r\nnavigate to your local project folder and run:  \r\n   `imdone`\r\n\r\n- You can start it in multiple directories and switch between projects in the UI\r\n\r\n###See it in action!\r\n- fork this repository and run imdone in your local copy.  I use the imdone for developing imdone\r\n####Tasks are just markdown links\r\n\r\n####Put a task at the top of a list called \"todo\"\r\n   `[this is a task](#todo:0)`\r\n####In javascript code\r\n   `//[this is a task in javascript code](#todo:0)`\r\n####Put a task on the bottom of a list called \"doing\" (giving it a sort value of 1000 will put it at the bottom unless you have tons of tasks in the list)\r\n   `[this is a task in doing](#doing:1000)` \r\n####Tasks are sorted by the number after the `:`\r\n####imdone will create a folder named imdone that will contain your custom configuration and a file to keep your lists in order\r\n- you should keep imdone in source control\r\n\r\n####Filter by file name\r\n- You can filter by the file name the task are in.  \r\n- As you type in the \"filter by file name\" field, tasks are filtered\r\n\r\n###Configuration\r\nAfter running imdone for the first time, modify imdone/imdone.js in your project directory.  The default config looks like this.  Your imdone.js will extend this.\r\n  \r\n\tmodule.exports = {\r\n\t\tinclude:/^.*$/,\r\n\t\texclude:/^(node_modules|imdone|target)\\/|^\\.(git|svn)\\/|\\~$|\\.(jpg|png|gif|swp)$/,\r\n\t\t//github : {url : \"http://www.github.com/piascikj/imdone\"}, //Use this if you want links to point at github\r\n\t\tmarked : {\r\n\t\t\tgfm: true,\r\n\t\t\tpedantic: false,\r\n\t\t\tsanitize: true\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t};\r\n\r\n###Release notes\r\n####0.1.11\r\n- Now able to hide a list from board using hidden\r\n#####imdone/data.js is now formatted like this\r\n  \r\n\t{\r\n\t\tlists:[],\r\n\t\thidden:[]\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n####0.1.10\r\n- Source view if github is not set\r\n- Default lists are respected if added to imdone/data.js\r\n- Lists won't be removed unless specifically removed in ui or imdone/data.js\r\n\r\n####0.1.8\r\n- Sort is fixed for multiple projects\r\n\r\n####0.1.7\r\n- Start in multiple project directories\r\n\r\n####0.1.6\r\n- Added filter by file name\r\n\r\n####0.1.4\r\n- Use line number when loading page in github\r\n\r\n####0.1.3\r\n- include added to config for files to include.
